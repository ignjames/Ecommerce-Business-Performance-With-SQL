# Ecommerce-Business-Performance-With-SQL
An e-commerce company gave its data analyst staff the task to track its business performances. It is important for the company to see what is happening with their business. By harnessing the insights from the data analyst team, the company could make a data-driven decision to grow the company.

## Data mining step:
- Create and import tables from the dataset.
- Analyzing customer activity growth such as average monthly active user, new customer, repeat order customer, and monthly average buy per customer.
- Analyzing product category quality such as annual revenue, highest selling category, the revenue of highest selling category, total cancelled order, and highest cancelled category.
- Analyzing payment types such as most used payment type and payment type frequency each year.

## Result
- Customer activity growth: From 2016-2018 every metric was giving positive results excluding the repeat order customer which was not increasing from 2017 until 2018. This could indicate that customers were just using the company's application during promotions and didn't return when there was a lack of promos.
- Product category quality: Health beauty categories became the most selling and cancelled product.
- Payment type usage: Credit cards are the most used payment type from 2016-2018
